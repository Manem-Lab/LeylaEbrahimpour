# NLST-Cancer Prediction


This project is for extarcting radiomics from NLST images with available segmentation. The data folder contains the IDs of Cohort1 and Cohort 2 used in this paper: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30507033/ for which I have the segmentations. 

For now, the python code extracts the studies information for which the segmentations are available.
