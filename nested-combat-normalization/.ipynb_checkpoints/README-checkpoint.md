# Nested Combat Normalization


This code is for harmonizing the extracted radiomic features using nested combat normalization based on https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08412-9. Using this code, the batch effect can be corrected for as many as batch parameters and batch levels. ComBat or similar approaches, rely on the assumption that samples within a batch share similar characteristics. Hence it is important to have enough samples within each batch level. In terms of radiomic features extracted from CT images, the reconstruction Kernel, the slice thickness, the model of the scanner, the manufacturer and the center can be considered as batch parameters. Giving the radiomics features extracted from CT images to this code as the input data, the effects of these parameters are corrected. The output is the corrected radiomic features.
