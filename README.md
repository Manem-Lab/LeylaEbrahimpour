# Projects done at Université Laval (IUCPQ+CRCHU) from October 2022 to June 2024

This collection contains the various projects I worked on during my postdoctoral research at Université Laval from October 2022 to June 2024. Each project directory includes its own README file to provide specific details and instructions.

## Overview

This repository is organized into several projects, each representing a significant piece of research or development I undertook during my postdoc period. 
The projects cover a range of topics and methodologies relevant to my field of study:
- extracting radiomic features from CT images,
- harmonization of radiomic features using ComBat method,
- developing ML based models for the prediction of survival endpoints, recurrence and cancer risk for lung cancer patients. 

The data used for these projects are
- CTs and segmentations of SynergiQc data available in https://platform.paradim.science which should be given access to, with clinical data uploaded to the corresponding folders
- NLST data with CTs and clinical data publicly available and segmentations done from earlier studies. Clinical data, IDs of the patients, and segmentations have been uploaded to the corresponding folder
- CTs and segmentations of the Oncotech project in an hd5 format available on Valeria

## Projects Structure

Each project is contained within its directory. For detailed information on a specific project, please refer to the README file within that project's directory.
