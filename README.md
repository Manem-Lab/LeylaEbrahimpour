# Projects done at Université Laval (IUCPQ+CRCHU) from October 2022 to June 2024

Welcome to this repository! This collection contains the various projects I worked on during my postdoctoral research at Université Laval from October 2022 to June 2024. Each project directory includes its own README file to provide specific details and instructions.

## Overview

This repository is organized into several projects, each representing a significant piece of research or development I undertook during my postdoc period. The projects cover a range of topics and methodologies relevant to my field of study:

- **Extracting Radiomic Features from CT Images**
- **Harmonization of Radiomic Features using ComBat Method**
- **Developing ML-Based Models for the Prediction of Survival Endpoints, Recurrence, and Cancer Risk for Lung Cancer Patients**

## Data Used

The data used for these projects include:

1. **SynergiQc Data:**
   - CTs and segmentations available on the [Paradim platform](https://platform.paradim.science) (access required).
   - Clinical data uploaded to the synergiqc-radiomics_extraction/data folder.
   - Extracted radiomics from Tumor and Non-Tumor regions on Valeria due to the huge size

2. **NLST Data:**
   - Publicly available CTs and clinical data from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST).
   - Segmentations done from earlier studies available in nlst-cancer-prediction/data/NLST-masks.zip
   - Clinical data, patient IDs, and labels uploaded to the corresponding project folders.

3. **Oncotech Project:**
   - CTs and segmentations in an HD5 format are available on Valeria.

## Projects Structure

Each project is contained within its own directory. For detailed information on a specific project, please refer to the README file within that project's directory.
