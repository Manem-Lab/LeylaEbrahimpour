# SynergiQc-Recurrence Prediction

This project is to predict Recurrence for patients of SynergiQc data with recorded recurrence as a binary (1 or 0)

data: contains different radiomics extracted from Tumors plus clinical data.

Src: contains ML codes to predict recurrence using radiomics and radiomics+clinical data. Because of the unbalanced dataset, balancing methods have been applied (combination of undersampling and oversampling, and giving weight).
